Any past experience in  blockchain technology, cryptography, cybersecurity or machine learning will be an asset.</p>


<span id="bright">Tips and Regrets</span></span></p>

<p>I get <b>a lot</b> of applications and questions about open positions. I look at every thing I receive but regret that I am unable to respond unless if there is a match. </p>


If you are applying for a PhD position, I require students to have a <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Research/CryptographySecurity/knowledge.html">solid background</a> in cryptography/security (my opinion is that a PhD is too late to shift research directions) and have some publications in recognizable venues in the field.
